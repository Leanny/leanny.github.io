        <h1>Quick tutorial to get SplatHeX running</h1>
        The base of the tutorial was provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/KiritoPro_">Kiri</a> and modified by me. 
        <h2>Stuff needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A micro SD card that is preferably not from Samsung</li>
            <li>A savegame manager (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/Checkpoint/releases/tag/v3.1.0">Checkpoint.nro</a>))
            <li><a href="https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher">Fusée Launcher</a> (recomended, for all OSs). Alternative you can use <a href="https://github.com/rajkosto/TegraRcmSmash">TegraRcmSmash</a> (<a href="https://switchtools.sshnuke.net/">Download here</a>, <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/tegrarcmgui-simple-gui-for-tegrarcmsmash.503510/">GUI version here</a>).</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Jan4V/hekate-ipl-50x/releases">Hekate Mod by Jan4V</a>. Download payload.bin and sdfiles.zip.</li>
        </ul>
        Kiri prepared the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4xviiw8wcrlw2q3/HBL.rar?dl=0">following pacakge</a> which contains most files needed. 
        <h2>Risks</h2>
        This method involves several risks. If you mess up the RCM boot by using unsave jigs, it might kill your switch. If you do save editing in general, there is always a chance for getting banned. If you only do legal modifications (e.g. add chunks), it will be harder to detect and the probability is lower that you will be banned. Be always aware of the risk this involves.
        <h2>Step 1:Preparing the SD Card</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Take the HBL.rar file that you downloaded and extract it. If you downloaded the single packages, extract all of them.</li>
            <li>Go to HBL\FW 5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2 and extract the content of the "sdfiles.rar" file and paste it to the root of your SD Card. If you downloaded "sdfiles.rar" as single file, just paste the content of the extracted archive to the root of your SD card.</li>
            <li>Make a new folder in the root of your sd card and call it "switch".</li>
            <li>Copy and paste all the file from the savemanager that you downloaded into the switch folder (or in a subfolder if you want it to be more organized)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 2: Getting your pc ready</h2>
        It is recomended to use Fusée Launcher. A tutorial for windows can be found <a href="https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher/wiki/Instructions-(Windows)">here</a>. 
        Way 1:
        <ul>
            <li>Go to HBL\Nintendo_Switch_APX_Mode and run "InstallDrivers.exe" as administrator. Hit next then finish.</li>
            <li>Now open up the "TegraRcmGUI.exe" file in the HBL folder and wait there.</li>
        </ul>
        Way 2 (copied from <a href="https://github.com/rajkosto/TegraRcmSmash">here</a>, prefered when Way 1 does not work):
        <ul>
            <li>Get your Switch into RCM mode and plug it into your Windows PC. It should show up somewhere (like Device manager) as "APX"</li>
            <li>Download and run Zadig driver installer from https://zadig.akeo.ie/</li>
            <li>From the device list, choose APX (if it's not showing up in the list, go to Options menu and check List All Devices)</li>
            <li>For the driver type, cycle the arrows until you see libusbK (v3.0.7.0) in the text box (IMPORTANT!)</li>
            <li>Click the big Install Driver button. Device manager should now show "APX" under libusbK USB Devices tree item.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 3:  Getting your switch into RCM mode</h3>
        <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/the-ultimate-list-of-mods-to-enter-rcm.502145/">The ultimate list of mods to enter RCM</a>. There are a lot of ways, the most commonly used one is the paperclip method.<br />
        Summary of what to do:
        <ul>
            <li>Turn you switch off.</li>
            <li>Remove the right joycon.</li>
            <li>By using a pin, a 3d printed jig or a screwdriver connect the pins (1st and last or last 2) located on the bottom of the right rail. (Just google how to do it properly)</li>
            <li>While the pin/jig/screwdriver is in place hold down the power button + the VOLUME UP button on the switch until the little switch icon on the program we opened earlier becomes green.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 4: Injecting the payload</h2>
		If you are using Fusée Launcher:
		<ul>
			<li>Use the following command in the commandline: 
			<pre><code>python fusee-launcher.py payload.bin</code></pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
        If you are using the GUI version of tegrasmash:
        <ul>
            <li>On the computer click on the little folder icon and choose the file "HBL\FW 5.0.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2\payload.bin"</li>
            <li>Click inject payload.</li>
            <li>On your switch used the power button to choose "launch software" then go down with the volume button to choose "CFW" with the power button again.</li>
        </ul>
        If you are using the cmd version of tegrasmash:
        <ul>
            <li>Drag & Drop payload.bin into tegrasmash.exe</li>
            <li>On your switch used the power button to choose "launch software" then go down with the volume button to choose "CFW" with the power button again.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 5:  Dumping the savefile</h2>
        Important: Do not let the switch go to sleep mode. Otherwise you need to force turn it off due to sleep mode not working properly. To force it to turn off press and hold the power button for around 20 seconds.
        <ul>
            <li>Your switch should reboot now and when it does open the album.</li>
            <li>The hombrew menu should boot up, open your savefile manager and dump your savefile.</li>
            <li>Turn off the switch and remove the sd card.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 6: Editing your save</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <a href="https://leanny.github.io/SplatHeX.html">SplatHeX</a> to edit your savegame.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 7:  Injecting your save</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Repeat STEP 4, 5 and 6 but instead of dumping the save, inject it. Make sure to choose the right game/user!</li>
            <li>Reboot you switch, and start the game.</li>
        </ul>
